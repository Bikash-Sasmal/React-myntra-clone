<h1>Myntra Clone App with React and Redux Toolkit</h1>

<p>This project is a clone of the popular e-commerce platform Myntra, developed using React and Redux Toolkit. The main functionalities of the app include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Clicking on the Myntra logo navigates users to the home page.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Add to Bag Feature:</strong> Users can add items to their shopping bag by clicking the "Add to Bag" button. Once an item is added, the button changes to a "Remove" button, allowing users to remove the item from their bag if desired. The changes in the bag status are reflected in real-time.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Bag Management:</strong> Users can view the items in their bag and remove them individually.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project showcases the integration of React for the user interface and Redux Toolkit for state management, providing a seamless and efficient shopping experience similar to Myntra.</p>
